# JavaScript Metronome

A simple metronome web app written in JavasScript and jQuery. It uses the [Howler.js](https://howlerjs.com/) library as a wrapper for the WebAudio API. This library will also fall back to HTML5 audio if WebAudio isn't available.

# Controls
There are 3 controls for the metronome:  
**Tempo:** The speed of the beat. (1 - 400 bpm)  
**Beats per bar:** How many times you want it to click per measure. (1 - 16)  
**Clicks per beat:** How many times you want it to click each beat. For example, if you wanted an 8th note subdivision, setting this value to 2 would accomplish that. (1 - 16)
